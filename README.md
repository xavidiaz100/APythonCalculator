# A Simple Python Calculator
Hello! This was my first ever personal project using Python. As soon as I saw tKinter I was hooked because I was just at awe with how many things you can do with it.
It is a multi-functional calculator with functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division.
I am going to continue to develop with calculator so that it may have more functions and is just overall more user-friendly
